## How to Use

### Prerequisites
- **CMake 3.27** or newer ([Download CMake](https://cmake.org/download/))
- C++17-compatible compiler (e.g., MSVC in Visual Studio 2022)
- Windows (the project uses Winsock, currently limited to this platform)

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YoshiRH/SimpleChat_App.git
   cd SimpleChat_App
2. **Build with CMake**
Ensure you have a C++ compiler installed (e.g., MSVC in Visual Studio).
Run the following commands:
   ```bash
   mkdir build
   cd build
   cmake ..
   cmake --build .
3. **Run program**  
Best way to run the program would be to go to program location in file explorer [project dir]/build/Server and [project dir]/build/Client
and from there run server app first and then how many clients you want from 'Client' directory to connect to server.

### Usage instructions     
**Start the server**
The server listens on 127.0.0.1:55555. Youâ€™ll see a startup message in the console.

**Connect a Client**     
After launching the client, choose:
(1) Register: Create a new account (e.g., user1, pass123).
(2) Login: Log in to an existing account.
Once logged in, you can start sending messages.

**Controls**   
Type a message and press Enter to send it to all logged-in users.
Type exit to disconnect and close the client.
